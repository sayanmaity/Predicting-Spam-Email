# Predicting-Spam-Email
This is a small  example of how to detect spam email from the list of email. 

We use the "spam" dataset from the kernlab package from R. This dataset, created in the late 1990s at Hewlett-Packard Labs, contains 4601 emails, of which 1813 are considered spam. The remaining are not spam. Additional details can be obtained by using ?spam or by visiting the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The response variable “type” is of type factor with levels that label each email as spam or nonspam. We use nospam as our base level.
